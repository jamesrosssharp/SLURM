New Emulator
============

Goals:

  - Rewrite in C++
  - On desktop, implement a JIT for faster emulation of CPU
  - Compile (without JIT) to web assembly for web if possible
  - Use OpenGL to render sprites, backgrounds, and copper effects
  - Execution frame locked to audio frame rate for zero audio stuttering
