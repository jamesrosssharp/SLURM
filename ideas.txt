Current implementation sucks.

Ideas to fix:-

- remove unnecessary instructions
	- don't need relative branches
	- don't need inc or dec
	- don't need three reg. alu operations

- remove hazard prediction code
	- this code is ugly and doesn't work well

- remove pipelining??
	- would drastically reduce performance

- simplify overall design
