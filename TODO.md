TODO

Changes for C compiler:-

- Assembled memory must be bytewise, not consist of 16 bit short words. This means all addresses must be byte addresses. This allows use of char in C,
 and also means pointer arithmetic generated by compiler will be correct.
	- DONE

Changes to RTL:-

- Add instruction for byte accesses to memory (add write mask to main memory to allow word writes)
- Remove fbdoubler. Instead, add a flag bit to the gfx core to allow pixel doubling. Then, large (320x200) bitmaps can displayed as sprites.
  This will free up 600 - 700 LUTs for use in adding more features to CPU and audio etc., as well as collision detection with background layers.

Emulator:-

	- need GFX
	- need sound
